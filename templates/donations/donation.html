    <h1>Make a donation</h1>

    <p>
        Thank you so much for visiting our donations page. We are a small not for 
        profit tech recruitment company. All donations are hugely appreciated as we 
        don't take even 1% of the funds generated by placing a candidate. We are completely 
        voluntary. Hard to believe right? But it's true. We, oursleves, struggled to land 
        our own perfect jobs for many years, and for that reason we are determined to help you 
        succeed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Again, thank you so much for your contribution. Every single donation helps us to help 
        you! Your donation will be processed by stripe, so you can be confident knowing that your 
        payment details are 100% secure.
